# Tycho
The Joolian moons, now complete, for all of KSP history there has been annoying ass gap between Tylo and Bop, Tylo is an analogue for Ganymede and I would always love to see another icy moon circling around the green giant. So Tycho is the answer, Tycho is called Tycho because it sounds similar to Tylo. This is my first mod so it is probably bad but I hope you enjoy.
